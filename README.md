# ModXo adapter board for RP2040-Zero / RP2040-Tiny
Unofficial board for the original Xbox modchip "[ModXo](https://github.com/Team-Resurgent/Modxo)" by Team Resurgent.

* Using the smaller (USB-C) version RP2040-Zero by WaveShare.
* Cut-out in the middle of the PCB to allow the RP2040 to lay flush / improve cooling.
* Using both universal footprints to support both SMD and THT for easier soldering / finding parts.
* Single-sided PCB for easier manufacturing.

See the [Release V0.2](https://github.com/Electrical5/ModXo-RP2040-Zero/releases/tag/V0.2) for the 'old' board.
